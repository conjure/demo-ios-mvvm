# Demo MVVM Project 

This is a demo project that provides the user with information on bus tops that are local to the user.  

## Requirements
This project requires that you enable location services on your device. Also, you will need to get a Transport for London API id and key from their developer's webpage.

Once you have the API id and key, please enter them in the Constants.swift file in the Xcode project.

```swift
    struct Constants {
        static let transportForLondonKey = "ENTER_TFL_API_KEY"
        static let transportForLondonAppID = "ENTER_TFL_API_ID"
    }
```
